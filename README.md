# Titanic-Data-AI_Machine-Learning-Project from Chris Romano's Python Machine Learning Masterclass

This is from my own work on the project.

##Summary/Overview:
Completed this project on December 12, 2024 reaching my goal to develop my first machine learning project. In this project, I learned the foundations of Machine Learning with a hands-on approach using python to analyze Titanic Dataset. The goal was to create and  determine the best machine learning model that will have the best accuracy in training the data. At the beginning of the project, I learned how to understand the process of Machine Learning and Data handling. I then explored the data further by conducting  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and also cleaning the dataset of non numerical values. I then developed 4 models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier. Out of the 4 it was determined that Random Forest Classifier was the winner with 82.12% accuracy. 


#The Types of things I learned and implemented in doing this challenge: 
✅ Learned the foundations of Machine Learning with hands on approach using python

✅ Learned and built 3 Machine Learning Models

✅ Understand the process methodology of Machine Learning and Data handling

✅ Ingesting your dataset

✅ Exploring it by using EDA techniques

✅ Cleaning the dataset

✅ Learned how to create your Machine Learning model and review the accuracy.

✅ Built and additional Machine Learning model and ranked it compared to the other models used in terms of the accuracy
